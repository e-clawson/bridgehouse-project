# Introduction
This document will remind you of the requirements of the course Capstone Project (CP), and give you final tasks to work towards for its completion.

Capstone Objective - Create a full-stack web application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node (MERN).

# Submission
When your project is finally complete, submit the link to your completed assessment using the Start Assignment button on the assignment page in Canvas.

Your submission should include:
A GitHub link to the repository for your completed project.
You will also be given the opportunity to present your project to guests, instructors, and/or a Talent Advocate Manager (not the class) upon completion. Lean into this opportunity to become accustomed with speaking about your work, both from a technical and non-technical perspective.
Your presentation should include:
A demonstration of the application.
An overview of the challenges you endured, and how you handled them.
A short question-and-answer period.
Your instructor will schedule practice presentations throughout the development phase.
